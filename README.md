# A 3-4 sentence self-critique memo of your project and your progress in class to this point.
I think I did a good job of fixing myIIT website problems. It was not mobile friendly, so I focused on reflecting that point on my page. I did HTML and CSS on schedule page. I made a timetable which size is differ to window size. Also, I tried to theme my page to match with original myIIT website.

# A 3-4 sentence critique of each group memberâ€™s work on the project.
Lara did great job on the login page. It really matches with our whole pages, and it works well. Aniello and Arthur also did great job on coding Welcome and class-lookup pages. They helped our team to fix our codes in a right way, and also did a great job on javascript. Syed made academic page. He also merged all CSS files into a single CSS file.
